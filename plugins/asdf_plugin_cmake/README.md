# `cmake` asdf plugin

This is the `cmake` integration for the [universal-asdf-plugin](../../) project.

[CMake](https://cmake.org/) is a cross-platform build system generator for C, C++, and many other languages that abstracts away platform-specific build tool details. It lets you define your project configuration once and generate native build files for environments like Make, Ninja, Visual Studio, and Xcode.

## Usage

```bash
# List available versions
universal-asdf-plugin list-all cmake

# Install latest version
universal-asdf-plugin install cmake latest
```
