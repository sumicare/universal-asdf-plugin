# `argo-workflows` asdf plugin

This is the `argo-workflows` integration for the [universal-asdf-plugin](../../) project.

[Argo Workflows](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows) is an open source, container-native workflow engine that runs complex CI/CD pipelines and data processing workloads on Kubernetes. It lets you model workflows as Kubernetes Custom Resources, making them easy to version, review, and observe alongside the rest of your cluster configuration.

## Usage

```bash
# Install the Argo plugin into asdf using universal-asdf-plugin
universal-asdf-plugin install-plugin argo

# Install the latest Argo CLI version with asdf
asdf install argo latest
```
